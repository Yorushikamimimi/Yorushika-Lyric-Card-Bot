## 📖 Introduction
A minimalist web bot that generates aesthetic lyric cards. It scrapes Japanese lyrics from **Uta-Net**, selects a random background image, and synthesizes a "Polaroid-style" card using **Pillow**.

Everything is served via a high-performance **FastAPI** endpoint.

## ✨ Features
- **Async Scraping**: Powered by `Playwright (Async)` to handle dynamic JS-rendering sites (Uta-Net).
- **Auto-Retry Mechanism**: Robust error handling with automatic retries and human-like delays.
- **Image Synthesis**: Uses `Pillow` to apply dark overlays, center text, and render Japanese fonts (Microsoft YaHei/Meiryo).
- **RESTful API**: Simple `GET /card` endpoint to trigger the pipeline.
- **Dockerized**: Ready to deploy on any Linux server.
